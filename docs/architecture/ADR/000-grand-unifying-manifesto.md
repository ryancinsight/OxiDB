# ADR-000: Grand Unifying Manifesto

## Status: PROPOSED

## Context

This document outlines the overarching architectural vision and guiding principles for the project. It serves as a foundational reference for all subsequent ADRs and technical decisions.

## Decision

We will adopt a modular, microservices-based architecture. Key components will communicate via well-defined APIs. Technology choices will prioritize scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

## Consequences

This approach will allow for independent development and deployment of services, fostering team autonomy and faster iteration cycles. However, it also introduces complexities in terms of inter-service communication, distributed data management, and operational overhead.
