# 00: Vision - The Oxidb Cathedral

## The Grand Vision

Oxidb is envisioned as a digital cathedral, a testament to the power of pure logic and flawless design in the realm of database systems. It is a learning project dedicated to implementing a pure Rust database, emphasizing safety, the idiomatic use of Rust-specific features (generics, traits), a deeply hierarchical file structure, and minimal dependencies.

Our goal is to construct a database system that is not only functional but also an exemplar of robust, maintainable, and elegant software architecture, intended to stand as a reference for centuries.

## Core Principles

*   **Safety and Integrity:** Leverage Rust's ownership model, type system, and compile-time checks to ensure data integrity and prevent common database vulnerabilities. The system must be a fortress of data safety.
*   **Rust Idioms:** Extensively utilize generics, traits, enums, and other Rust-specific features to create flexible, maintainable, and type-safe code. The design should feel inherently "Rusty."
*   **Architectural Clarity:** Implement a well-organized, hierarchical file structure with clear separation of concerns. The architecture should be as transparent and understandable as a master blueprint.
*   **Minimalism & Focus:** Rely on the Rust standard library as much as possible, introducing external crates only when absolutely necessary and justified. The design will focus on core database functionalities, avoiding feature bloat.
*   **Educational Value:** Serve as a practical and comprehensive project for understanding database internals, advanced Rust programming paradigms, and the principles of building large-scale, reliable software.

## Enduring Goals

*   To create a functional database prototype that embodies the principles above.
*   To prioritize data safety and integrity above all else.
*   To deeply explore and demonstrate efficient data storage and retrieval techniques within the Rust ecosystem.
*   To provide a meticulously clear and well-documented codebase that serves as a learning resource for future architects.

This vision is the unchanging northern star guiding all design and development decisions for the Oxidb cathedral.
