# oxidb: A Pure Rust Database

## Overview

oxidb is a learning project to implement a pure Rust database emphasizing safety, Rust-specific features (generics, traits), a deep vertical file tree structure, and minimal dependencies. This project aims to explore database design principles and Rust's capabilities in building performant and safe systems.

## Goals

*   **Safety:** Leverage Rust's ownership and type system to ensure data integrity and prevent common database vulnerabilities.
*   **Rust Features:** Extensively use generics, traits, and other Rust idioms to create flexible and maintainable code.
*   **Deep Vertical Hierarchy:** Implement a well-organized file structure with clear separation of concerns (at least 5 levels deep).
*   **Minimal Dependencies:** Rely on the Rust standard library as much as possible, only introducing external crates when absolutely necessary.
*   **Learning & Exploration:** Serve as a practical project for understanding database internals and advanced Rust programming.
