- Social network analysis
- Recommendation engines
- Research relationship mapping

```bash
cargo run --example knowledge_graph_rag
```

### 4. **SQL Compatibility Demo** (`sql_compatibility_demo.rs`)

Comprehensive demonstration of PostgreSQL/MySQL-compatible SQL syntax:
- **DDL Operations**: CREATE TABLE with constraints, indexes, foreign keys
- **DML Operations**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE with various patterns
- **Complex Queries**: JOINs, subqueries, aggregations, GROUP BY, HAVING
- **Advanced Features**: CASE statements, string functions, transactions
- **Real-world Schema**: Complete e-commerce database with relationships

**Use Cases**:
- Migrating from PostgreSQL/MySQL to OxiDB
- Learning SQL with a familiar syntax
- Building traditional relational database applications
- Testing SQL compatibility

```bash
cargo run --example sql_compatibility_demo
```

### 5. **Shakespeare RAG Comparison** (`shakespeare_rag_comparison.rs`)

Real-world comparison of RAG vs GraphRAG approaches:
- **Document Processing**: Downloads and processes Shakespeare works
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compares retrieval speed and relevance
- **Character Relationships**: Maps relationships in plays
- **Thematic Analysis**: Searches by themes (love, death, power, etc.)

**Results**:
- RAG: 38.4x faster (2.41ms vs 92.77ms average)
- GraphRAG: 90.3% more relevant results

```bash
cargo run --example shakespeare_rag_comparison
```

### 6. **Simple Blog** (`simple_blog/`)

A blog application with:
- Post creation and management
- User authentication
- Comments system
- Category organization

```bash
cd examples/simple_blog
cargo run
```

## üèóÔ∏è Building Your Own Examples

To create a new example:

1. Create a new `.rs` file in the `examples/` directory
2. Add it to `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [[example]]
   name = "your_example"
   path = "examples/your_example.rs"
   ```
3. Import OxiDB:
   ```rust
   use oxidb::{OxiDB, OxiDBError};
   use oxidb::core::types::{DataType, OrderedFloat, VectorData};
   ```
