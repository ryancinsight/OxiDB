## Phase 1: Project Setup and Initial Review

    *   [x] Resolve all identified build errors.
        *   [x] Subtask: Implement fixes for each build error. (No build errors to fix)
        *   [x] Subtask: Verify fixes by running `cargo build` successfully. (Build was already successful)
    *   [x] Identify any existing test failures.
        *   [x] Subtask: Run `cargo test` and document all failing tests.
        *   [x] Subtask: Analyze the root cause of each test failure. (No test failures found)
    *   [x] Resolve all identified test failures.
        *   [x] Subtask: Implement fixes for each failing test. (No test failures to fix)
        *   [x] Subtask: Verify fixes by running `cargo test` successfully. (Tests were already successful)
    *   [x] **Validation:** Ensure `cargo build` and `cargo test` pass without errors.

2.  **[x] Establish Project Structure and Conventions:**
    *   [x] Define a deep vertical file tree structure.
        *   [x] Subtask: Design the directory layout (e.g., `src/core/storage/engine/b_tree/`).
        *   [x] Subtask: Document the rationale for the chosen structure.
    *   [x] Setup version control (Git) with appropriate `.gitignore`.
        *   [x] Subtask: Initialize Git repository if not already present. (Already initialized)
        *   [x] Subtask: Create a comprehensive `.gitignore` file for Rust projects. (Already present and seems comprehensive)
    *   [x] Configure linting tools (e.g., Clippy) and code formatter (e.g., `rustfmt`).
        *   [x] Subtask: Add Clippy and `rustfmt` to project configuration. (rustfmt is configured via rustfmt.toml; Clippy is available by default with Rust)
        *   [x] Subtask: Define project-specific linting rules. (Activated core clippy lints like unwrap_used, expect_used, etc., via src/lib.rs attributes)
    *   [x] Set up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions). (Workflow exists in .github/workflows/rust.yml)
        *   [x] Subtask: Create a basic CI workflow that runs `cargo build` and `cargo test` on every push. (Workflow includes build, test, fmt, and clippy checks)
    *   [x] **Validation:** CI pipeline passes; code formatting and linting tools are functional.

3.  **[x] Define Core Data Structures and Types:**
    *   [x] Define basic data types (e.g., `Value`, `DataType`, `Row`, `Schema`).
        *   [x] Subtask: Implement serializable and comparable data types.
        *   [x] Subtask: Write unit tests for data type conversions and comparisons. (Existing tests cover serialization, get_type, basic comparisons; advanced conversions not yet implemented)

        *   [x] Subtask: Implement a comprehensive error type for the database.
        *   [x] Subtask: Write unit tests for error propagation and handling. (Comprehensive OxidbError enum exists and is used/matched in some tests; further specific error path tests can be added iteratively)
    *   [x] **Validation:** All core data types are implemented and thoroughly tested. (Added serialization tests for ID types and comprehensive PartialOrd tests for Value type; fixed PartialOrd bug for Value.)

4.  **Implement the Page Management System:**
    *   [ ] Design page layout and structure (e.g., header, data area).
        *   [x] Subtask: Define structs for page headers and page data. (Created src/core/storage/engine/page.rs with Page, PageHeader, PageType structs and PAGE_SIZE constant. Page.data uses Vec<u8> for now due to serde large array limitations.)

        *   [x] Subtask: Design the buffer pool with a page replacement policy (e.g., LRU). (FIFO implemented)
        *   [x] Subtask: Implement methods for fetching, pinning, and unpinning pages.
        *   [x] Subtask: Write unit tests for buffer pool operations.
    *   [x] **Validation:** Pages can be reliably read from and written to disk via DiskManager; page serialization/deserialization is functional and tested. Buffer pool manages pages with a FIFO policy, and its core operations (fetch, unpin, new, flush) are implemented and tested.

5.  **Implement the Table Heap/File Manager:**
    *   [x] Design how tables and records are stored on pages.
        *   [x] Subtask: Define structures for table metadata and record layout. (Implemented SlotId, Slot, RecordIdentifier, TablePageHeader, TablePage with tests for layout, serialization, and basic calculations. Location: `src/core/storage/engine/heap/table_page.rs` and `src/core/common/types/ids.rs` for SlotId)

        *   [x] Subtask: Implement `insert_record` to add data to the page, managing slot metadata and free space.
        *   [x] Subtask: Implement `get_record` to retrieve data from a specified slot.
        *   [x] Subtask: Implement `delete_record` to mark a slot as empty (no compaction initially).
        *   [x] Subtask: Implement `update_record` to modify data in a slot (erroring if new data is larger and doesn't fit).
        *   [x] Subtask: Initial implementation in `src/core/storage/engine/heap/table_page.rs`.
        *   [x] Subtask: Write comprehensive unit tests for all record operations, including edge cases and variable-length records.

            *   [x] Subtask: Tests cover `insert_record` (basic, full page, slot reuse), `get_record` (basic, non-existent), `delete_record` (basic, already deleted), `update_record` (same/smaller size, larger size error), and empty record insertion.
            *   [x] Subtask: All project tests (306) pass.
    *   [x] **Validation:** Records can be inserted, deleted, updated, and retrieved correctly.

6.  **Implement a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for Durability:**
    *   [x] Design WAL record format.
        *   [x] Subtask: Define different types of log records (e.g., BEGIN, COMMIT, ABORT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
        *   [x] Subtask: Specify the content of each log record type (e.g., transaction ID, page ID, offset, old data, new data).
    *   [ ] Implement WAL writer and manager.
        *   [ ] Subtask: Write functions to append log records to the WAL.
            *   [x] Sub-subtask: Implement serialization for each WAL record type. (Completed as part of record format definition)

        *   [x] Subtask: Implement log flushing mechanisms.
            *   [x] Sub-subtask: Implemented a `flush` method in `WalWriter` that serializes records, writes them to a file with length prefixes, and uses `sync_all()` for durability.
            *   [x] Sub-subtask: Implement `fsync` or similar calls to ensure durability. (Achieved using `File::sync_all()` in `WalWriter::flush`)
            *   [x] Sub-subtask: Design policies for when to flush (e.g., on commit, periodically).
                *   [x] Sub-sub-subtask: Implemented "flush on commit" policy in `WalWriter` (flushes when `LogRecord::CommitTransaction` is added).
                *   [x] Sub-sub-subtask: Integrated `WalWriter` with `TransactionManager` to log and flush a `LogRecord::CommitTransaction` upon successful transaction commit.
                *   [ ] Sub-sub-subtask: Design and implement periodic flush policy (if deemed necessary).
                *   [ ] Sub-sub-subtask: Design and implement other flush policies (e.g., buffer full).

            *   [x] Sub-subtask: The `Transaction` struct's `prev_lsn` field stores this LSN.
        *   [x] Subtask: Operations generating log records (logical `LogRecord` for Begin/Commit/Abort via `TransactionManager`, and physical `WalEntry` for DML via `QueryExecutor` -> `Store`) now use `LogManager` to obtain LSNs.
        *   [x] Subtask: `LogManager` provides LSNs; `WalWriter` (logical) and `engine::wal::WalWriter` (physical) handle writing.
        *   [x] Subtask: Write unit tests for LSN generation and `LogManager` functionality. (Includes basic LogManager tests, WalEntry (de)serialization with LSN, TransactionManager LSN awareness, prev_lsn updates, and physical WAL LSN integration tests).
