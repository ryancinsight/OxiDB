# OxiDB WASM Build Summary

## Overview

Successfully configured OxiDB to compile to WebAssembly (WASM) and resolved all build errors. The database can now run in web browsers with full in-memory database functionality.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Cargo.toml Updates

- Added `[lib]` section with `crate-type = ["lib", "cdylib"]` to support WASM compilation
- Separated platform-specific dependencies:
  - **Non-WASM targets**: Full-featured dependencies
  - **WASM targets**: Browser-compatible versions with specific features

```toml
# Platform-specific dependencies
[target.'cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))'.dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json", "rustls-tls"], default-features = false }
uuid = { version = "1.8.0", features = ["v4"] }

# WASM-specific dependencies
[target.'cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")'.dependencies]
getrandom = { version = "0.2", features = ["js"] }
wasm-bindgen = "0.2"
wasm-bindgen-futures = "0.4"
web-sys = "0.3"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["sync", "macros", "time", "rt"], default-features = false }
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"], default-features = false }
uuid = { version = "1.8.0", features = ["v4", "js"] }
```

### 2. WASM Module (src/wasm.rs)

Created a dedicated WASM module that:
- Provides JavaScript-friendly API through `wasm-bindgen`
- Wraps OxiDB's Connection API
- Converts query results to JSON for easy JavaScript consumption
- Handles error conversion from Rust to JavaScript

### 3. Build Issues Resolved

1. **getrandom**: Added `js` feature for WASM targets
2. **mio/tokio**: Disabled `net` feature for WASM (networking not supported in browser)
3. **uuid**: Added `js` feature for JavaScript-based random number generation
4. **Value enum**: Fixed variant names (`Boolean` instead of `Bool`)

## Build Commands

```bash
# Install prerequisites
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-pack

# Build WASM package
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg

# Or direct cargo build
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --lib
```

## Testing Infrastructure

1. **wasm_test.html**: Interactive web page for testing database operations
2. **serve_wasm.py**: Python HTTP server with proper WASM MIME types and CORS headers
3. **WASM_BUILD_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive documentation

## Current Status

✅ **Successful WASM compilation**
✅ **All dependency conflicts resolved**
✅ **Web-friendly API implemented**
✅ **Testing infrastructure in place**
✅ **Documentation created**

## Usage Example

```javascript
import init, { WasmDatabase } from './pkg/oxidb.js';

await init();
const db = new WasmDatabase();

// Execute SQL
await db.execute("CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)");
await db.execute("INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice')");

// Query data
const result = await db.query("SELECT * FROM users");
const data = JSON.parse(result);
console.log(data.rows); // [[1, "Alice"]]
```

## Limitations in WASM

- In-memory databases only (no file system access)
- No networking features (browser sandbox)
- Some async runtime limitations
- Performance may differ from native builds

## Next Steps

To use OxiDB in a web application:

1. Build the WASM package: `wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg`
2. Include the generated files in your web project
3. Import and initialize as shown in the usage example
4. Deploy with proper WASM MIME type configuration

The WASM build is now production-ready for browser-based applications requiring an embedded SQL database.
