## 🔧 **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **1. Generic Embedding Systems**

#### **TF-IDF Embedder (Traditional RAG)**
```rust
pub struct TfIdfEmbedder {
    vocabulary: HashMap<String, usize>,
    idf_scores: HashMap<String, f32>,
    pub dimension: usize,
}
```

**Features:**
- **Vocabulary Building**: Automatic vocabulary extraction from any document collection
- **IDF Scoring**: Inverse Document Frequency for term importance weighting
- **Normalized Vectors**: L2 normalization for accurate similarity calculations
- **Adaptive Dimensionality**: Dimension based on vocabulary size (max 512)

#### **Semantic Embedder (GraphRAG)**
```rust
pub struct SemanticEmbedder {
    dimension: usize,
    feature_extractors: Vec<Box<dyn FeatureExtractor>>,
}
```

**Feature Extractors:**
- **NamedEntityExtractor**: Detects persons, organizations, locations
- **ContentFeatureExtractor**: Analyzes document structure and linguistic features
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add domain-specific extractors

### **2. Universal Entity Extraction**

#### **Entity Types Supported**
```rust
// Generic entity patterns that work across all domains
let person_indicators = vec![
    "mr", "mrs", "ms", "dr", "professor", "captain", "sir", "lady", "lord",
    "king", "queen", "prince", "princess", "duke", "duchess", "count",
];

let organization_indicators = vec![
    "company", "corporation", "university", "school", "college", "hospital",
    "government", "department", "agency", "organization", "institution",
];

let location_indicators = vec![
    "city", "town", "village", "country", "nation", "state", "province",
    "street", "avenue", "road", "building", "house", "castle", "palace",
];
```

#### **Theme Detection**
```rust
let theme_patterns = vec![
    ("EMOTION", vec!["love", "hate", "anger", "joy", "sadness", "fear", "hope"]),
    ("CONCEPT", vec!["freedom", "justice", "peace", "war", "truth", "beauty"]),
    ("ACTION", vec!["battle", "fight", "journey", "quest", "discovery"]),
    ("RELATIONSHIP", vec!["friendship", "marriage", "betrayal", "alliance"]),
    ("TIME", vec!["past", "present", "future", "ancient", "modern"]),
];
```

### **3. Generic Relationship Detection**

#### **Universal Relationship Types**
- **WORKS_WITH**: Professional collaborations and partnerships
- **AFFILIATED_WITH**: Organizational memberships and associations
- **LOCATED_IN**: Geographical and spatial relationships
- **ASSOCIATED_WITH**: Thematic and conceptual connections
- **LEADS**: Leadership and management relationships
- **BELONGS_TO**: Ownership and membership relations
- **INFLUENCES**: Impact and effect relationships
- **SUPPORTS**: Assistance and backing relationships

#### **Confidence Scoring**
```rust
fn calculate_relationship_confidence(&self, text: &str, entity1: &str, entity2: &str, pattern: &str) -> f64 {
    // Proximity-based confidence calculation
    let min_distance = find_minimum_distance(entity1_positions, entity2_positions, pattern_positions);
    let max_distance = 500.0;
    let normalized_distance = (min_distance as f64) / max_distance;
    (1.0 - normalized_distance).max(0.0).min(1.0)
}
```
