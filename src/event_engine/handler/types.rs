// This file defines the "Skeleton" of the event handling system:
// the data structures that represent events and their processing outcomes.

/// Represents the different types of events that can occur in the system.
/// These are placeholders and will be expanded based on actual system needs.

    DataUpdated { resource_id: String, old_value: String, new_value: String, changed_by: String },

/// Defines the result of processing an event.
/// Using `anyhow::Result<()>` for now for flexible error handling.
/// This can be replaced with a more specific error enum if needed.
pub type EventResult = anyhow::Result<()>;

// Ensure Cargo.toml has anyhow dependency.
// Read Cargo.toml.
// If `anyhow = "1.0"` (or similar) is not in `[dependencies]`, add it.
// For now, we assume `anyhow` might be needed and the subtask should check/add it.
// If adding, it should be `anyhow = "1.0"`.
