# Event Handler (`src/event_engine/handler/`)

This is a Sectional Blueprint for the Event Handler, a crucial component within the Event Engine.

## Purpose

The Event Handler is the operational core of the Event Engine. It takes defined events and orchestrates their processing according to the system's business logic and architectural principles.

## Structure (Internal Composition)

Following the Law of Internal Composition, this module is organized into:

*   **`types.rs` (The Skeleton):**
    *   Defines the `Event` enum, representing all possible events the system can handle.
    *   Defines `EventResult` and any specific error types for event processing.
*   **`core.rs` (The Mind):**
    *   Contains the primary `process_event` function. This function is the entry point for event processing and will embody the "Flat Logic" principle after refactoring.
*   **`processors.rs` (The Soul):**
    *   Defines the `Processor` trait.
    *   Contains concrete implementations of the `Processor` trait for each event type, encapsulating the specific logic for handling that event. This promotes modularity and allows for clear separation of concerns.
*   **`tests.rs` or `tests/` (The Immune System):**
    *   Houses unit tests to ensure the correctness and robustness of the event handling logic, including individual processors and the overall dispatch mechanism.

## Architectural Principles

*   **Duality of Depth and Flatness:**
    *   *Deep Structure:* This handler module itself is part of the deeper `event_engine` structure.
    *   *Flat Logic:* The `process_event` function in `core.rs` will be refactored to achieve flat logic, delegating to `Processor` implementations.
*   **True Names:** File names (`core.rs`, `processors.rs`, `types.rs`) are chosen to clearly communicate their role within the module's anatomy.
*   **Fractal Perfection:** If any file within this handler (e.g., `processors.rs` if it grows too large with many processor implementations) exceeds complexity or line count thresholds (~300 lines), it will be promoted to its own subdirectory (e.g., `processors/`).

## Interaction Flow

1.  An event originates from some part of the system.
2.  The event is passed to `process_event` in `core.rs`.
3.  `process_event` identifies the appropriate `Processor` for the event.
4.  The `Processor`'s `process` method is called, executing the specific logic for that event.
5.  The result is returned.
